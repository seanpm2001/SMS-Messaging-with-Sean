# SMS-Messaging-with-Sean 
General info on the rules, responses, time, language, privacy, and security of messaging with me via SMS. 

***

## About

See above. This repository is a guide to messaging me via text. Despite this project using the term SMS, it is actually full-on texting support. Prior to a May 5th 2021 edit, I just associated SMS as text messaging. It is still being used as a loose term. <!-- This repository is a guide to messaging with me via SMS messaging (text messaging) !-->

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

### Guide

This is the guide to texting me.

### Terminal

I am working on a command line system for SMS messaging that will automatically take certain inputs and respond for you when I am not available, or when you need common info.

Here is the planned terminal system (incomplete)

```java
If location=undefined {

PhoneCalls=disabled;
ComPeriod=int(1100, 2000); // 11:00 am to 8:00 pm
str MessageFreq(MessageFrequency = "very_low");
MessageConLevel=bool(SFW);
}
```

Messages in this format are automated and are processed through a server when they start with ;\\//:

Commands:

<!-- (Note from May 5th 2021, this command data is really bad, and is going to be completely rewritten) !--> <!-- pure crap !-->

```python
timeRule sleep = 2300 # Sets the sleep time to 11:00 pm PST
print "hello world" # Everything after the # is treated as a comment and ignored
stop.log # Stops message archive collection
start.log # Resumes message archive collection (command currently unavailable)
```

```minecraft

@a - messages everyone

@e - also messages everyone

@pst - shows current Pacific Standard Time
```

This little code will prevent your next message from being sent and will just enter it as a command. The bytecode itself will not be sent as a message/

```bytecode
%%OFF$
```

The complex 6 char bytecode is so that no conversation will trigger its usage.

These commands are coming soon

SMS-Terminal

```
schoolday = true
```

When you define that you go to school:

```text
Phone calls disabled

Communication period: ask for before and after each day, once a week, or once a month

Content type=SFW
```

### Text times

Times I automatically won't respond: random, I respond when I am available between 8:00 am and 11:00 pm.

Times you can't text: none (text me any time of the day or night. Just note that I might not get to you. I try to respond, but I won't be able to respond if I am sleeping, or working)

Times you can't text without punishment: during a lecture at school, during a job meeting, etc. generally, just avoid this. As much as school seems like it sucks, it is still helpful, and it wouldn't be worth losing your phone, making the teachers job more difficult (teachers really are under-appreciated) and disrupting your class over this. Wait until after school, or when your school gives you time to be on your phone (such as during a lunch break, on the bus, before or after school, etc.)

### Response rate

Response rate: I currently don't respond very frequently at certain times of the day. Sometimes it may seem like I have abandoned the conversation, but actually I might just not know how to respond

### Translations

My preferred language is English (I will translate messages in other languages, although I may not understand it, due to the rate of errors in machine translation)

### Sensitive info

Do not **EVER** share my phone number online (or with others) my phone number currently needs to remain semi-private.

Other sensitive info to never text to me includes:

* Passwords

* Sensitive email addresses

* Social Security number

* Your PIN

* Credit/Debit card numbers

* Other info of this type

Also, do not text me any of the following:

* Genital pictures

* Other sexual pictures (pictures can contain sexual humor, just don't send me this too much)

* Pornography/erotica

* Gore videos and images

I will block you on the spot if you send any of these 4.

You can send me almost anything else, such as:

* Memes (anytime you want, any platform you choose. Note: I do not have a bias for Reddit memes, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, iFunny, 9Gag, Me.me, memecenter, or other meme sites, unless the site is a anti-semitic support site)

Unfortunately, I have to limit you to 256 memes per day. I have to set some boundary. It is likely you will never need to send so many in a 24 hour period anyway.

* Nature pictures

* Questions (Tech support, technical, opinion, other)

* Pet pictures

* Other

### Emoji

My device currently supports Emojis from Emoji 1.0 to Emoji 12.0 (As of March 10th 2021) I am fine with Emoji usage, just keep it in moderation. Unless you are sending me a copypasta, messages with text shouldn't contain an excessive amount of emojis (such as 1 for every word) responding with just a few emojis is fine, again just remember to keep it in moderation.

### Special effects

My device does not support special effects (such as Confetti) it will send as a broken message, but I will still receive, I just won't see the animation.

### Phone calls

I do not accept phone calls from anyone unless it is a close family member or support group

### Emergency contact

You can add me as an emergency contact, but I am not able to travel out to help you at the moment. I can help with emotional or mental problems. I will be one of your resources for this.

### How to add me to your contacts

[Android guide](https://support.google.com/contacts/answer/1069522?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en) - Warning: support.google.com link

[iOS guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207207) Lesser warning: support.apple.com link

[Other OS: unavailable at the moment](https://www.example.com)

### Sample pictures

Do you want to add a custom picture of me but don't want to ask? Here is a collection of 20 sample pictures you can use as my contact if you can't find anything else:

<!--
Sample pictures you can use if you want (at least 20 pictures to be included, located at /profilePic/Sample/)
!-->

[View all sample pictures here](/ProfilePic/Samples/)

### Group chats

Please ask me before adding me to a group chat, or else I might have to block your number to prevent mine from getting leaked

### Advertising

You can send me good or bad advertisements and give your thoughts on them/ask me for my thoughts on them. Just don't send me an ad link

Also, I don't use your texting data for advertisements EVER. I have no use for them in the process of ad production

### AMPutate your links

If you are using Google Search, Google Chrome, or a mixture of the 2, please do not send me Google AMP links. I will not respond to them.
Google made a service called AMP that threatens the open Internet and gives Google control of how a website should function. Ever since Google Chrome 69, the full URL is hidden in the address bar. When sending me a link, look for the following:

```link
.amp.google
```

And take it out.

Also note that I don't accept links to Google owned sites (this includes YouTube) send me a YouTube link when you absolutely cannot find it anywhere else (Vimeo, DailyMotion, BitTube, Reddit, Twitter, etc.)

Also check out [Google AMP anti-](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Why-you-should-avoid-Google-AMP) and my [Degoogle Campaign](https://github.com/Degoogle-your-life).

### Facebook and Instagram

I do not have an accessible FB (FaceBook) or IG (Instagram) account, so I can't view what you send me through here.

### Stickers

You can send me stickers, but use them in moderation. Also, try to use them creatively, and a reward will be sent your way.
